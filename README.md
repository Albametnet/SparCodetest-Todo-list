# Sparta To-do List

This project is a simple To-do List created with Reactjs accesible with a simple login. (with sparta-inspired stylesüòé)

## How it works.

When open the app, first thing we can see is a login page to access to de private area of the app.\
This login have no real server response so in this particular case it doens't matter what user data we write because the request always let us access to our To-do list. It could be a good template to implement server logic in the future.

Once inside it shows a bar with a button to create new tasks and a list of tasks. We can create, read, update and delete tasks.
